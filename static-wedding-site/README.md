# Wedding RSVP Static Website

Welcome to the Wedding RSVP project! This static website is designed to provide guests with all the necessary information regarding the wedding event and to facilitate the RSVP process.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document for the wedding RSVP page, containing sections for event details, RSVP form, and contact information.
- `css/styles.css`: The stylesheet for the website, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the RSVP page.
- `js/script.js`: The JavaScript file that includes functionality for form validation, handling user interactions, and dynamically updating content on the page.
- `images/`: A directory for storing image files used in the website, such as photos of the couple, venue, or decorative elements.
- `fonts/`: A directory for storing custom font files that may be used in the website to enhance typography.
